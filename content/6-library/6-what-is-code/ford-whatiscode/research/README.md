# EMACS IS THE BEST TEXT EDITOR AND CLOJURE IS THE BEST LANGUAGE IT
# FEELS SO GOOD TO SAY THOSE THINGS OUT LOUD

Hi this is Paul.

I love Businessweek and think it is one of the finest editorial
organizations in the world. I love their web team and think they are
hilarious and weird which is my finest praise.

This is the code I wrote to write my article. It's not good
code. It's just all the little odds and ends you use when you're
writing a big long article about code and you are desperate to tell
a clear honest story about something enormous and diverse. Lots of
these languages I've barely used, like Fortran or K. Others are old
favorites.

I look forward to your feedback.
