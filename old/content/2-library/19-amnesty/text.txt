From *(link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodchild_and_Other_Stories text: Bloodchild and Other Stories)*

"A woman named Noah works as translator between humans and a species of alien invader referred to as the Communities. The arrival of the Communities has crashed the economy; humans are dependent now on the aliens for employment and food. Many humans died in the days of early contact — the aliens experimented casually on them to discover what the human body could and could not withstand. The humans have not forgiven this." — (link: http://www.salon.com/2006/03/17/butler_3/ text: Source)
