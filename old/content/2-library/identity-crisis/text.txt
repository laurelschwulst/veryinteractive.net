A POSTER AT ODDS with itself recently made the rounds on New York’s subway cars and platforms. The upper half was a tour de force of sans-serif typography, a pocket of restraint amid an otherwise giddy advertisement for Jeff Koons’s retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The words “Whitney” and “Jeff” were spelled out in block letters that echoed the Upper East Side institution’s mid-century Brutalist building, once described in this magazine as “a forward assault-position for America’s artists.”1 A set of diagonal lines zigzagged through the remaining space. These underscored a connection to the museum’s reverse ziggurat form while providing some moderate visual dynamism. Though bordering on abstraction, the configuration of lines retained just enough structure for the attentive rider to decipher a stretched and distorted “W.”

Below, these typographical markers of cultural sophistication—versions of which appear on all of the museum’s advertisements and comprise what designers call the institution’s “identity”—collided with the poster’s major graphic element: a cartoonish, mischievous kitten, its face and paws protruding from a knit sock. It’s one of Koons’s monumental sculptures, a work that appears at once aggressively phallic and innocent. Flattened and scaled on the poster, however, the picture was remarkable mainly because it was so cloying and sweet.

The adorable feline slipped in between the block letters spelling out the artist’s last name. The austere type was compromised further with a visual trick, one far less subtle than the careful oscillation between abstraction and meaning embodied in the springy “W.” Two pastel flowers positioned on either side of the kitten’s head stood in for the two “O”s in “Koons.” A tagline channeling the nonsense rhetoric of blockbuster movie trailers appeared at the bottom of the poster: “A Retrospective as Audacious as his Art.”

What makes Koons so audacious (and bodacious?) in the eyes of many critics is his ability to upturn cultural hierarchies by using banal imagery and objects as source material for lavishly produced paintings and sculptures. Quite a lot of this source material could be properly called graphic design. The Whitney retrospective includes actual Nike posters and liquor advertisements that Koons appropriated (i.e., purchased and hung in a gallery).

Of course, Koons is hardly a pioneer in this operation. A fairly comprehensive narrative of 20th-century art, from Picasso to the Pictures Generation, could focus entirely on artists claiming and recontextualizing the work of graphic designers. These acts of aesthetic privatization—the rebranding of common and collaboratively produced imagery as the work of an individual artist—have been celebrated by progressive-minded critics and historians for their critical potential to reveal the ideologies underlying for-profit mass media.

Yet if we attempt to apply the logic of appropriation in reverse—consider the myriad instances of designers borrowing tropes from modernist art, such as the nods to geometric abstraction found in the subway ad—the result is a bit murkier. Rather than a clear-cut inversion of “high” and “low,” we can perceive a circular process: designers quoting artists who were themselves quoting from various forms of design. The cultural hierarchies that figures such as Koons thrill to violate become a muddle. This ad is a particularly stark example of the necessary conflicts and cross-purposes underlying the relationship between the contemporary artist and designer. Here, the lowly designers supply all the markers of aesthetic ambition in contrast to which the artist’s insipid imagery becomes legible as something more than kitsch. In turn, the image (of a cartoonish artwork that is actually among the most opulent luxury goods produced in recent memory) appears almost to taunt the typography (on this subway ad) for its air of uptight elitism.
