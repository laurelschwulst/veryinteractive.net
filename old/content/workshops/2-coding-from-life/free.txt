## Instructions

1. Download this (link: http://veryinteractive.net/content/workshops/coding-from-life/coding-from-life.zip text: starter kit).

2. During class today, we will make two still life drawings using only HTML and CSS. You will have about one hour for each one.

3. Follow my demo. Then you’ll do your own still life drawings.

When you’re done, you should have two div's with class of "canvas" on your page. Each should contain a different drawing you did in class. Make sure to link your “Coding from Life” drawings from your class homepage.
