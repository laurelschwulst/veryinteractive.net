(image: dust.png)

It has been compiled for the Yale Graphic Design courses "Networks and Transactions" taught by Dan Michaelson, and "Interaction Design and the Internet" taught by Laurel Schwulst.

Inside are readings used in both courses, as well as the transcripts from "Vacuuming and Digesting," a public conversation series in Fall 2017 led by Dan Michaelson, Laurel Schwulst, and Ayham Ghraowi. The series discussed themes relevant to both classes.

This Spring 2018 edition was edited by Ayham Ghraowi, Ghayde Ghraowi, and Laurel Schwulst.
