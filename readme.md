======================
This website is a hub for courses I teach. It archives related materials as a resource for past and future students or web visitors, whether the class is in session or not.

The site sometimes sports special themes when the class is not in session.

### Colophon

Design and programming is by [Beautiful Company](http://beautiful-company.com).

The site is built on [Kirby CMS](http://getkirby.com/).

### Installation

After downloading, add a new folder “content” to the root directory. Inside “content”, add two new empty folders: “error” and “home”.

I like to use [MAMP](http://mamp.info) to locally run PHP. If you use MAMP, place folder in MAMP’s “htldocs” folder. Navigate to /panel and you should be on your way.
